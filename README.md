# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to help Louise identify how the different campaigns fared in relations to their launch dates and their funding goals. We used the dataset that was collected to find those for Louse. After finding results we will present it in more readable and manageable sets to understand the results better.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the challenges and difficulties that were encountered were the understanding of different campaigns and the overwhelming data collected. Those datasets could be difficult to analyze if we don't know what we are looking for.
## Results

#- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The overall conclusion for the Outcomes based on Launch date is that they have overwhelmingly shown to be a success. Every month had more successful campaigns compared to the canceled or failed campaigns so we can take that to be a good indication moving forward. The second conclusion is that failed and canceled campaigns stayed throughout the different months the data was analyzed and we can take those conclusions to better assess what they are doing wrong. 

##- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The conclusion for outcomes based on goals seems to interchangable, this can be said because as the of canceled outcomes stayed consistent the number of canceled and successful outcomes for changing. The numer successful outcomes were not consistent based on each goal similar to the failed outcomes. The campaign can use this to reflect why those weren't consistent throughout the different goals. 

###- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some Of the limitations for this data set is that there can be so many conclusions that can be made about the outcomes. However, with so little information about the different scenarios we can only focus on the things in front of us. 

####- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Other possible tables and/or graphs that could be used are pie-chart for outcomes based on goals. Having the two side by side will give us the information we need to have a better conclusion. One can also use line graphs to see the difference in results throughout the campaigns which gives us a clear view about the dataset.
